## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
\begin{align*}
$\Delta DIC_{global} = \Delta DIC_{respiration} + \Delta DIC_{alkalinity}$
$\Delta DIC_{North Pacific} - \Delta DIC_{North Atlantic} = \Delta [CO_{2}] + \Delta \frac{Alkalinity}{2}$
\end{align*}
```
