# Spawning Behavior and Larval Biogeography of Bering Sea Marine Fishes
## Project Overview

This repository includes all code and data for my M.Sc. thesis and associated manuscripts (expected thesis completion date: 6/15/2022). These analyses were conducted at Oregon State University within the Marine Resource Management program and under the oversight of my advisor, Dr. Lorenzo Ciannelli. 

The Bering Sea is a region of intense environmental variability which leads to extremely productive yet often volatile marine fish communities. Recruitment variability, often attributed to differential survival of early life stages (eggs and larvae) of marine fishes, can spell economic and environmental disasters within this region. Over millennia, fishes have adapted their spawning behavior to ensure the survival and subsequent recruitment success of early life stages, yet spawning behavior operates within spatial and temporal constraints that vary among species. For instance, some species may spawn only in geographic locations like fjords or bays, at which they come into contact at certain points of their lives. Others may rely on environmental cues, like ice breakup or seasonal temperature progression to commence spawning. For my thesis, I sought to quantify the variability in space and time of spawning behavior among marine fishes with diverse life history strategies as they relate to environmental variables through the use of generalized additive models. If species are more constrained in either space or time, they may be less resilient to climate change in the future. Further, if we better understand _how_ species are typically constrained, we can create more adaptive management and conservation strategies.

While spawning behavior is one piece of the puzzle regarding recruitment variability of fisheries, illuminating larval biogeography of the region will also lend insight to the ecological and physical dynamics at play. I used generalized additive models and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) transects across the Bering Sea to better understand patterns of larval biogeography across species with the hypothesis that some species will prefer differential temperature and salinity environments than others. An assessment of where larvae occur and at what times of the year will be very useful to inform future ichthyoplankton surveys on shifting species distributions and potential periods of recruitment variability. 

### Organizational Structure and Description of Data
---

The "Organized Thesis Analyses (Code)" folder contains all code files, organized by species and ichthyoplankton type (egg or larvae) from initial data loading and cleaning to production of generalized additive models. The "Ichthyo Data" folder contains all raw and cleaned ichthyoplankton data while the "Environmental Data" folder contains cleaned and compiled CTD data as well as local and regional temperature indices for the Bering Sea. Though not fully populated yet, the "Figures" folder will house figures created for the manuscript and thesis. 

Ichthyoplankton and environmental data were collected by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center Ecosystems and Fisheries-Oceanography Coordinated Investigations program and metadata regarding these cruises can be found [here] (https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/icc/index.php).
