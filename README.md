# Thesis_GAM_Analyses

This repository includes all code and data for my M.Sc. thesis and associated manuscripts. These analyses were conducted at Oregon State University within the Marine Resource Management program and under the oversight of my advisor, Dr. Lorenzo Ciannelli. 

The Bering Sea is a region of intense environmental variability which leads to extremely productive yet often volatile marine fish communities. Recruitment variability, often attributed to differential survival of early life stages (eggs and larvae) of marine fishes, can spell economic and environmental disasters within this region. Over millennia, fishes have adapted their spawning behavior to ensure the survival and subsequent recruitment success of early life stages, yet spawning behavior operates within spatial and temporal constraints that vary among species. For my thesis, I sought to quantify the variability in space and time of spawning behavior among marine fishes with diverse life history strategies as they relate to environmental variables through the use of generalized additive models. If species are more constrained, they may be less resilient to climate change in the future. 

While spawning behavior is one piece of the puzzle regarding recruitment variability of fisheries, illuminating larval biogeography of the region will also lend insight to the ecological and physical dynamics at play. I used generalized additive models and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) transects across the Bering Sea to better understand patterns of larval biogeography across species with the hypothesis that some species will prefer differential temperature and salinity environments than others. An assessment of where larvae occur and at what times of the year will be very useful to inform future ichthyoplankton surveys on shifting species distributions and potential periods of recruitment variability. 

The "Organized Thesis Analyses (Code)" folder contains all code files, organized by species and ichthyoplankton type (egg or larvae) from initial data loading and cleaning to production of generalized additive models. The "Data" folder contains all raw and cleaned ichthyoplankton data and cleaned and compiled CTD data for the region.
